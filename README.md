# Liu Woods (LiuWoodsCode)
Hi, I'm LiuWoodsCode, a GitHub user who likes to create projects using various programming languages. Some of my projects are:

- LiuOS: A small Python project meant to imitate the functions of a regular operating system. It has 5 stars and 1 fork on GitHub.

- browser: A simple Android web browser based on webview that I forked from another repository.

I also have some config files for my GitHub profile, which you can check out here. Feel free to explore my repositories and leave a comment or a star if you like them. Thanks for visiting!
